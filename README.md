This is the repository for team-6 containing source/code files of various algorithms/compmetitive-coding problems solved in different languages.

The languages are, but not limited to rust, c/c++, python, java, etc.

---

## These are the steps to execute the source-code files in various languages.

The following steps assume you have the compiler installed for these languages and the envirnoment set up.
Typically, they are commands and expect you to be running on a Unix/Winwows-WSL/Powershell terminal.


### C

```
gcc filename.c
./a.out
```

### C++

```
gcc filename.cpp
./a.out
```

### Rust

**Using Cargo**

```
cd prg-folder
cargo run
```

**Using rustc**

```
rustc filename.rs
```

### Python

```
python filename.py
```

### Java

```
javac filename.java
java filename
```
