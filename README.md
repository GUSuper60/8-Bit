## These are the steps to execute the source-code files in various languages.

The following steps assume you have the compiler installed for these languages and the envirnoment set up.
Typically, they are commands and expect you to be running on a Unix/Winwows-WSL/Powershell terminal.


### C

```
gcc filename.c
./a.out
```

### C++

```
g++ filename.cpp
./a.out
```

### Rust

**Using Cargo**

```
cd prg-folder
cargo run
```

**Using rustc**

```
rustc filename.rs
```

### Python

```
python filename.py
```

### Java

```
javac filename.java
java filename
```
